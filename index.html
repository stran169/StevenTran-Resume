        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Steven Tran, a first year business major at the Univeristy of California Riverside. In my time here, I hope to be able to meet new people, learn skills and get insight into areas I have not yet explored, and lastly make an impact on the community around me in a meaningful way. I grew up in a single parent household, consisting of only my mom, my aunt, my younger cousin, and me. Times were tough sometimes as I felt like I was missing a father figure to guide through the parts of life that traditionally, fathers would teach their sons how to navigate through. However, I saw how hard my mom and aunt worked to provide for my cousin and I so, my mentality shifted to one of being the next one to help my family out when they cannot provide for me anymore which is the same mentailty I want to share to the community of UCR. Striving to meet that challenge, I will push myself to be there when the people and community I am a part of need my assistance. That is what makes me who I am, and I'm proud to uphold those values. I wouldn't be here where I am today without the support I recieved from all the people that were part of my life when I needed them most.<br><br>

        Mt time and experience in the workplace leading up to my attendance at UCR consisted mainly of entry-level jobs. The first one being a delivery driver for several different companies such as Postmates, Instacart, and Doordash for approximately 2 months. Working those jobs opened my eyes to customer interaction, deadlines and timed assignments, and the ability to work quickly but accurately. My next job was at Daiso USA, a retail store for about 4 months. That job provided me additional experience with customer interaction, handling of the register both opening and closing, and how to efficiently coordinate with team members to complete daily challenegs and quotas. Lasty, my current job at UCR is at the Glasgow Dining Hall, which I have been working for 6 months and counting. The job revealed to me the interal operations of a restaurant that serves nearly 6000 customers daily. The team effort and coordination skills that I have aquired, the knowledge on how to operate industrial kitchen equipement, and the leadership skills that I have picked up while working at Glasgow have made me into a much more matured worker than when I started my first job. All of the job experiences that I have gone through has allowed me to be a capable team member and team leader if need be.  <br><br>

         My proffesional experience also extends outside of the traditional workplace and into other extracurriculer activities. The most prevelant of these activities being a police explorer for the Monterey Park Police Department. As an explorer, I volunteer around the city of Monterey Park to not only improve the community, but to build a stronger relationships between the citizens of Monetery Park and the police men and women who serve them. This position and experiences that come with the role have honed my leadership ability, team member coordination and communication, and my own self ability to complete the task at hand correctly, and efficiently. Those are the jobs and extracuricular activities that defines who I am today.
